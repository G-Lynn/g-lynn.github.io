The relationship between housing costs and homelessness has important implications for the way that city and county governments
respond to increasing homeless populations. Though many analyses
in the public policy literature have examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal mechanisms of homelessness (Byrne et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2003; Fargo et al., 2013), few
studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same
community (McCandless et al., 2016). To examine trends in homeless
population counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is given to modeling uncertainty in the
homeless count generating and measurement processes, and a critical
distinction is made between the counted number of homeless and the
true size of the homeless population. For each metro under study, we
investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference
to potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is
explored, and evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the
rate of homelessness from 2011-2016 depends on prior beliefs about
the accuracy of homeless counts. A main finding of the study is that
the relationship between homelessness and rental costs is strongest
in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.
