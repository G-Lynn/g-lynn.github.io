I am an assistant professor of Decision Sciences at the University of New Hampshire's Paul College of Business and Economics.  As a 2018-2019 Zillow Research Fellow, I collaborate with the real estate analytics company on research at the intersection of data science, housing markets and public policy. Prior to joining the faculty at UNH, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington where I worked with Professor Emily Fox. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistical Science from Duke University under the supervision of Surya Tokdar.
