I am an assistant professor of Decision Sciences at the University of New Hampshire's Paul College of Business and Economics.  In the 2018-2019 academic year, I was awarded a Zillow Research Fellowship to support research at the intersection of data science, housing markets and public policy. Prior to joining UNH, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington where I worked with Emily Fox. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistical Science from Duke University under the supervision of Surya Tokdar.
